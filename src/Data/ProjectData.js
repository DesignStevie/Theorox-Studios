      "My squads objective was to shift a pre-existing on premise software to an all cloud solution while improving all usability. We came across a large feature where we needed to look at improving vastly which was the onboarding process of a new Cardholder/User, this would be a new feature compared to the on premise software but still utilising small existing features.",
    understand:
      "First we looked at the existing on premise solution as it was below average when it came to usability. I gathered as much information about the existing solution from across the business by initiating a Design Sprint",
    research:
      "I then began talking and interviewing our existing customers that use this feature on a day to day basis, these customers would fit our targeted persona as well so that we know we are getting information from actual users. \n \n We set out to find pain points with the existing solution and getting feedback as to how our users would imagine a better solution would look like. \n \n Because the current solution is quite all over the place we found out through our customers that a step-for step process in onboarding a new Cardholder/User where all the necessary steps can be provided for them seemed to be a potential solution.",
    ideate:
      "We proceeded together with the squad on discovering some lo-fi ideas to create a step-for-step solution for onboarding a new Cardholder/User. \n \n We already had a form of a Wizard in mind prior to the ideation phase but we still continued to see if we can find some unique ideas in adding on to the wizard. \n \n After the ideation phase the squad voted on their most preferred design ideas and we decided fully to proceed with a form of Wizard and added in parts of other designs to further enhance the final feature.",
    prototype:
      "After we put together all the pieces in our ideation phase I then set out to create the final prototype where we can go and test with our customers/users. \n \n I designed a hi-fi prototype in Figma using the design system I created for our entire department for all our different platforms and projects. \n \n After going back to my squad for some refinements, feedback and critiques I then came up with a final solution that I could go test.",
    validate:
      "I experimented with a new way of testing our prototypes by using a platform called Useberry. Userberry is an online platform where I am able to upload my Figma prototypes, create questions and give some content as to what I want to be testing. \n \n Because we have customers all across the world I thought it would be great to create this on Useberry and send out a mass link to all our external customers where they can in their own time complete the test. \n \n I received way more result than expected which was great and viewed all recordings and completion rates and found that the prototype was a great success. We moved this straight over to development. ",
    finalSolution:
      "After receiving all the results we were happy to move this over into our next planned sprint where we can build this feature in different parts for MVP (minimal viable product) and get our customers to begin using it with their own real world data. \n \n We still look to continue refining and making the experience even better as we receive more feedback and suggestions from our customers. \n \n We already began investigating a customised Wizard experience tailored to the users preference and what steps they use and don't use to make their workflows even faster for onboarding Cardholders/Users.",
